# Frontend (React + Vite)

This folder contains a small React app (Vite) implementing:

- Registration (Patient / Doctor)
- Login (Patient / Doctor / Admin)

All submissions are currently client-side only and are logged to the browser console.

Setup
1. From the `frontend/` directory, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the printed local URL (e.g. `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser.

Notes
- This is a demo scaffold. Replace the console.log calls in `src/pages/*` with real API calls when you connect to your backend.
